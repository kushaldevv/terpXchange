## Accomplished So Far
As a group, we have accomplished brainstorming and designing the layout of our mobile application TerpExchange. Some of the design processes we have implemented revolve around: 
- Implementing a basic user authentication login system. In this case we decided to use google authentication to restrict only UMD students to be able to create an account on the login screen. This way we intend only UMD students to have access to buying and selling products on our application. 
- Implementing a post item page so once a user has created a profile, they will have access to posting an item, adding image and item description so that other people may be able to see the available products for sale (Also implementing camera feature to allow user to take a photo of their product to be sold). 
- Navbar to change into different screens (e.g. home, chat, post, account)
- Implementing item filter to categorize elements/products that are displayed on the home page
- Adding elements/images to the home page so there is a gallery of images of products to be bought/sold. 
- Implementing logo for application as well as a loading screen for a friendly user experience. 


Attached below is a series of images of the implementation design processes of our application:
