We have also added a lot of functionality to the app:
- Users are able to add reviews of a specific user with a star rating system. These reviews are displayed on ReviewView. 
- Users can upload photos when posting an item

We also added a back-end using Google Firebase

- Google authentication to determine if users are UMD students. If a user logs in email other than terpmail it gets rejected.
- Main users collections added on firebase. This stores info such as name, email, reviews, items posted, profile picture, userid
